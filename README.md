# Building a Furigana Machine

In the Japanese language, there are three different forms of written language. Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. The Kanji characters are a derivation of traditional Chinese characters, and over time they have become a writing system of their own. In Japanese writing, the three forms Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji all mix to express information in newspapers, books and posters. When studying Japanese, it is an initial hurdle for learners to be able to read these Kanji characters, as they have different readings depending on what other characters surround them. To help learners, furigana was invented, as a form to show the reading of the Kanji characters in Hiragana. An example is shown in the image below.
